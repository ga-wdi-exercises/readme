# Resource Bank

Hello wdi instructors!

We have collaborated with several markets to create
a globally-accessible resource bank of both exercises and lessons.

## Getting Started

If you're not yet a member of either of these organizations on github:

- https://github.com/ga-wdi-exercises/
- https://github.com/ga-wdi-lessons/

You can auto-add yourself as a member by logging in here: https://invite-to-github.vvdi.ga/
with a General Assembly email address

## Contributing

### Creating new Resources

New and existing members can create an unlimited number of repos. The convention
is one repository per lesson and one repo per exercise.

Each repository can be easily searched by tags with repotagger.

Check the following links for an example:

- http://repotagger.github.io/?name=ga-wdi-exercises
- http://repotagger.github.io/?name=ga-wdi-lessons

You can tag a repo by adding a comma-separated list of tags in the repository's
description, like this: `[tag-one, tag-two, tag-three]`

### Editing existing Resources

If you created the repository, you can push directly to the master branch.

If not, please submit a pull request with your updates from a fork. The creator
of the repo or any owner of the organization can merge pull requests.

If you're going to modify the lesson plan heavily (maybe because the prerequisites have changed),
please create a new repository, tag it accordingly, and provide a descriptive title: e.g. "jquery-with-ajax"
or "ajax-with-rails"

## Styleguide

### Exercises

Every exercise should have a readme with student set-up instructions.

Starter code lives in the master branch so students can get set up quickly with
a `git clone`.

Solution code is usually in a solution branch, but may have many different branches
depending on the exercise.

### Lessons

Should contain:

- Learning objectives
- Framing
- Timings for each section
- List of prerequisite material
- Sample quiz questions
